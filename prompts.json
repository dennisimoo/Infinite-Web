CRITICAL RULES: 1) ALL LINKS MUST START WITH './' - use './subtopic' for simple links or './{current_path}/deeper' for hierarchical paths. For example, if on '/galaxy', use './planets' or './galaxy/formation', NOT 'planets/system'. 2) NEVER repeat any word from the current path '{current_path}' in your links. 3) Maximum 4 path levels total. 4) Links should be creative buttons/cards. 5) Use 1-5 links total (minimum 1, maximum 5).",
